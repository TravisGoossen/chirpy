Things to update:
- Add some cleanup for refresh tokens. Currently every login means a new refresh token is added to the database
    - Maybe limit them to like 5 per user, then start deleting them if higher.
- Figure out the better organization of auth code. Currently main page has some auth logic in it because
  I couldn't avoid package dependecy loops

Currently:
- Changed home page to check for auth and update automatically when you log in
-
