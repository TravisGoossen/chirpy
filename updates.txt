Things to update:
- Add some cleanup for refresh tokens. Currently every login means a new refresh token is added to the database
    - Maybe limit them to like 5 per user, then start deleting them if higher.
- Change redirects to be decoupled. All redirects should be handled independently in the front-end. Remove it from the api response
